# Groot_Sample

These notebooks give an introduction on machine learning from an official statistical perspective.
It is still the first version of it, so excuse the mistakes. From a theoretical point of view, it gives a lot of insight how we look at machine learning from a statistical, methodological point of view.

clone the project to your own computer with 
`git clone https://github.com/mputs/Groot_Sample.git`

Start jupyter lab:
`jupyter lab`

Then start with `statistics.ipynb`

When you are ready with statistics, you can start `Machine Learning.ipynb`

Have fun!
